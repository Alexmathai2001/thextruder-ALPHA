PROBLEM STATEMENT:
TRADITIONALLY  FRESH  FISH  HAS  BEEN  SOLD  THROUGH  DOWNWARD BIDDING AUCTIONS OPERATING IN  DIFFERENT AUCTION HOUSES CLOSE TO THE HARBORS.
IN  THIS  CASE, THE  BUYERS  SHOULD  BE  PHYSICALLY  PRESENT  IN  THE MARKET HALL.THIS IMPOSES TWO MAIN BARRIERS.FIRST, IT RESTRICTS THE POTENTIAL BUYERS TO THOSE PRESENT 
IN THE AUCTION HOUSE.
SECOND,   IT   MAKES   THE   PARTICIPATION   IN   SEVERAL   AUCTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY   COSTLY,   AS   COMPANIES   HAVE   TO   SEND   A REPRESENTATIVE TO EACH ONE.

SOLUTION:
We propose an online bidding platform in which the stocks for the bidding will be from the fishermen in which buyers and sellers can easily participate in the auctions remotely.
firstly the fisherman should register in the (GO FISHIN') website giving all the details.
The unregistered ones could not sell their fishes in the website.
Furthermore,the system does not alter the current operation of the auction houses.Here, our website will handles by government authorized agencies.
In order to permit each auction house to continue having control over the buyers which are authorized to participate in thier auctions.
Human buyers must register in each auction house before this auction house authorizes buyer agents to participate on thier behalf.
In this system buyers are getting fishes witthout any intermediaries.So the illegal price hike can be avoided.
The fishes are randomly checked and tested to build the trust of the buyers and fresh fish is reaching to the doorsteps.

NEED OF THE PROJECT:
TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY IN FISH TRADING

TO BUILD TRUST TO THE BUYERS

TO MONITRATE ILLEGAL PRICE HIKE OF FISH IN THE MARKETS 

TO ENSURE PROPER PROFIT FOR THE FISHERMEN

TO AVOID WASTAGE OF FISH PRODUCTS

TO AVOID THE LONGER STEPS IN RETAILING FISH TO NORMAL PEOPLE

TO PARTICIPATE IN FISH AUCTIONS REMOTELY

TO GET GOVERNMENT TESTED HIGH QUALITY FRESH FISH IN THE MARKETS
